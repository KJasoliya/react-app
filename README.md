## react-app
I have created project with dummy data, the nav part contains link for three blogs(dummy). Each nav click results in displaying of the content in that page.
I have also attached my video files for setup and website execution along with it.

To run the project node modules should be installed in the machine, after the module installation open the project in the terminal and write the command npm start

The commands that I followed were:
```
  npm install -g create-react-app
  create-react-app my-react-app //To create my app named my-react-app, writing some code
  npm start
  ```
